# pandas-challenge-1
## By Sami Chowdhury
This was a more involved assignment but a rewarding one. I feel more comfortable using pandas dataframes, transforming dataframes, and other pandas dataframe functions, and was able to calculate everything required from me in this assignment. Using the class assignments were the only resources I needed to help me solve the assignment. In cell 232 about storing the client IDs, however, I did have a question to receive feedback on how I could store the client IDs from the value_counts result in a more programmatic function. Any feedback is appreciated as always.

**To run this code, after cloning into this repository and changing directory to *pandas-challenge-1*, please run the following python notebook:**

**I apologize, I forgot to change the name of the notebook before making updates, but this notebook listed above is my final submission with all my work. All my answers, code, and findings for this assignment are located in the above file**
