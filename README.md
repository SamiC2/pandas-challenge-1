# pandas-challenge-1
## By Sami Chowdhury
This was a more involved assignment but a rewarding one. I feel more comfortable using dataframes and was able to calculate everything required from me in this assignment. Using the class assignments were the only resources I needed to help me solve the assignment.

**To run this code, after cloning into this repository and changing directory to *pandas-challenge-1*, please run the following python notebook:**

``wholesale_data_analysis_starter_code.ipynb``
